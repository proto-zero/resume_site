      <p>In most turn-based role-playing-games, when you encounter an enemy, you are given a menu that includes things like health, status, and a list of actions that you can perform.</p><br>
      <p>I find I enjoy creating menus in the terminal; trying to create a loop that changes just enough to modify the menu but not break it. I enjoy the illusion of making a repeating set of strings that looks like a static page.</p>

        <p><strong>Game Screen Layout</strong></p><br>
      </div>
      <p>For this project I started with creating the menu screen.</p><br>
      <p>I interpolated the variables into the strings to help with the spacing on the screen. Ending the screen using print allowed the user input to appear, rather than beneath the menu, in the same line as ACTION. It gives the user a sense that they are typing inside the program instead of manipulating it from the outside.</p><br>
      <p>The menu has been refined as more features have been added. Having it exist as its own method made implementing changes easy to track inside the code stack.</p>

      <p>The loop itself is rather clean:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First we run the screen method which includes <code>system("clear")</code> to keep the menu in its position.</li><br>
        <li><code>@defense</code> is reset to zero.</li><br>
        <li>The user input is accepted and set to downcase. Whatever they choose activates the appropriate method (attack, defend, magic). If their choice isn't recognized their turn is effectively skipped.</li><br>
        <li>If the player has dealt enough damage to the enemy (or runs away) the <code>@status</code> text is replaced accordingly. This screen lasts for 2.5 seconds before cutting to the Game Over and Credit Scren.</li><br>
        <li>The enemy takes their turn to attack the player.</li><br>

      <p>When the player chooses to attack the attack method is called. It picks a random number between 0 and 99.</p><br>
      <p>If the attack number is less than 70 than the attack is successful and a damage variable is created. This is also a random number between 1 and 5. This amount is subtracted from the Enemy Health variable</p><br>
      <p>If the attack number is less than 18 then it is a critical hit and deals more damage than normal, between 6 and 10.</p><br>
      <p>Any attack numbers above 70 miss and the enemy does not take damage.</p>

      <p>Of course, defending against an attack can be dangerous, and there is a small chance that the player will stumble, leaving themselves vulnerable to attack. The defense variable is automatically set to -5 which will increase any enemy damage.</p>

          <li>Fire burns the enemy, dealing 2 damage for 2 rounds.</li><br>
          <li>Lightning stuns the enemy, decreasing the amount of damage they can deal to the player for 2 turns.</li><br>

      <p>The map is created by using a nested loop:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, an empty array is created.</li><br>
        <li>Next a loop runs for the size of the map, in this case 10.</li><br>
        <li>Each row gets a spot in the array, and for each row it is matched with a number of columns, making the array a two-dimensional array.</li><br>
        <li>Each spot in the array is designated with a * and an empty character for even spacing. I used colorize to create a red tinted map.</li>

      <p>The first part of the Game Logic clears the screen.</p><br>
      <p>The player and enemy positions are created inside the array. The player is hardcoded in so they appear in the same place every time while the enemy row and column are random.</p><br>
      <p>To draw the map we use another nested loop.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In order to center the map a number of blank spaces are placed on each line. This is a print function, allowing the next step to appear on the same line.</li><br>
        <li>Each column spot of the array is printed. Only once every part of that line of the map is printed will a new line be created.</li><br>
        <li>The loop repeats, drawing each set of columns for the number of rows in the array, ending with a 10x10 grid.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once the map is drawn the player and enemy positions are reset to *s so that way, when they move, they won't leave a trail.</p>

      <p>The loop pauses for player input. Using WASD the player may move around the map.</p><br>
      <p>Each movement key either increases or decreases the value of the corresponding row or column in the array. When the screen redraws the map the player will appear to have moved.</p><br>
      <p>The enemy moves after the player does, using a random number to decide which direction to travel.</p><br>
      <p>The game checks that either player or enemy is not already at the edge of the map, and if so will not allow them to move off of the map and out of the range of the array.</p><br>
      <p>If the player and enemy end their turn with the same row and column coordinates, meaning they land in the same space, the combat menu class is called and battle commences.</p>

      <p>I enjoyed how many different ideas I was able to bring together to make this game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building the combat menu as a class with a series of methods</li><br>
        <li>Requiring the class in the map program, as well as the colorize gem</li><br>
        <li>Creating a map with icons that both move randomly and with player input</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the future I hope to increase the functionality by having more than one enemy to fight, as well as adding items to the map that may increase player stats in combat.</p>
