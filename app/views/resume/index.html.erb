      <h2>Hi, I'm Sean</h2>
      <p>I am a <strong>Software Developer</strong>, and a <strong>Professional Actor</strong>.</p><br>
      <p>I like to build things. Plays, characters, programs, websites.</p>
      <p>I like to communicate with an audience, to interact with other players, to find interesting and unique ways to solve problems.</p><br>
      <div class="magic_container">In other words, I have a strong desire to <div class="magic"><em>express myself.</em></div></div><br>
      <p>Let me take you through some of the Projects I have created while attending Academy Pittsburgh and learning the Ruby Programming Language. If you want to dive right into my github you can do so <a href="https://github.com/proto-zero/Projects" target="_blank">here</a>. </p><br>

      <p>In most turn-based role-playing-games, when you encounter an enemy, you are given a menu that includes things like health, status, and a list of actions that you can perform.</p><br>
      <p>I find I enjoy creating menus in the terminal; trying to create a loop that changes just enough to modify the menu but not break it. I enjoy the illusion of making a repeating set of strings that looks like a static page.</p>

    <div class="text rpg_description">
      <p>For this project I started with creating the menu screen. I interpolated the variables into the strings to help with the spacing on the screen. Ending the screen using print allowed the user input to appear, rather than beneath the menu, in the same line as ACTION. It gives the user a sense that they are typing inside the program instead of manipulating it from the outside.</p><br>
      <p>The menu has been refined as more features have been added. Having it exist as its own method made implementing changes easy to track inside the code stack.</p>

    <div class="text rpg_description">
      <p>The loop itself is rather clean:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First we run the screen method which includes <code>system("clear")</code> to keep the menu in its position.</li>
        <li><code>@defense</code> is reset to zero.</li>
        <li>The user input is accepted and set to downcase. Whatever they choose activates the appropriate method (attack, defend, magic). If their choice isn't recognized their turn is effectively skipped.</li>
        <li>If the player has dealt enough damage to the enemy (or runs away) the <code>@status</code> text is replaced accordingly. This screen lasts for 2.5 seconds before cutting to the Game Over and Credit Scren.</li>
        <li>The enemy takes their turn to attack the player.</li>
        <li>If the enemy deals enough damage to the player then the game ends</li>
      </ul>
