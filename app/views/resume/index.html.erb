      <p>In most turn-based role-playing-games, when you encounter an enemy, you are given a menu that includes things like health, status, and a list of actions that you can perform.</p><br>
      <p>I find I enjoy creating menus in the terminal; trying to create a loop that changes just enough to modify the menu but not break it. I enjoy the illusion of making a repeating set of strings that looks like a static page.</p>

      <p>For this project I started with creating the menu screen.</p><br>
      <p>I interpolated the variables into the strings to help with the spacing on the screen. Ending the screen using print allowed the user input to appear, rather than beneath the menu, in the same line as ACTION. It gives the user a sense that they are typing inside the program instead of manipulating it from the outside.</p><br>
      <p>The menu has been refined as more features have been added. Having it exist as its own method made implementing changes easy to track inside the code stack.</p>

        <li>If the player has dealt enough damage to the enemy (or runs away) the <code>@status</code> text is replaced accordingly. This screen lasts for 2.5 seconds before cutting to the Game Over and Credit Scren.</li><br>

        <li>Next a loop runs for the size of the map, in this case 10.</li><br>

        <li>In order to center the map a number of blank spaces are placed on each line. This is a print function, allowing the next step to appear on the same line.</li><br>

      <p>The enemy moves after the player does, using a random number to decide which direction to travel.</p><br>
      <p>The game checks that either player or enemy is not already at the edge of the map, and if so will not allow them to move off of the map and out of the range of the array.</p><br>

      <p>Prior to creating Battle Fantasy, <a href="https://github.com/proto-zero/Projects/tree/main/garden_box" target="_blank">this project</a> started off as an assignment in Academy Pittsburgh where we needed to store user information in a database and use it to calculate the area and perimeter of a garden box, then tell the user how many of their choice of crop they can plant within that garden box.</p><br>
      <p>I made the project twice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first time I created several arrays populated with several different dialogue options and had the program randomly select the dialogue presented to the user.</li><br>
        <li>The second time around, on a whim, I wanted to drastically change the User Experience from a simple text-based interaction to a more stylish menu.</li>

      <p>I created the first screen to resemble a menu, much like I would later go on to do with the Battle Fantasy combat menu.</p><br>
      <p>I set the variable <code>lw</code> to be the line width in order to center the text. If I need to resize the screen I need only change one variable at the top instead of several.</p><br>
      <p>The loop relies on the conditional <code>if</code> statement to proceed. It asks if length is equal to 0, which at the moment it is not. It then asks if the width is equal to 0. Since it is, it prints the prompt <code> width: </code> to allow the user to respond on the menu itself.</p><br>
      <p>Once the width is set a few things happen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the length variable is set to 0, thus allowing the next iteration to access the first <code>if</code> statement.</li><br>
        <li>the X-Axis is updated with the width.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The user is prompted to give the length of the gardenbox which will update the Y-Axis. The loop is ended and we move on to the second screen.</p>

      <p>The program draws the map outline of the gardenbox, then asks the user to choose a crop to plant. It uses a <code>join</code> method to display all of the crops from the database previously stored in an array as a single line, spaced out with dashes for style.</p><br>

      <p>The three crops in the database are carrots, corn, and beets. Each takes up a different square footage, meaning there are fewer beets possible to be planted than corn, and fewer still than carrots.</p>

      <p>While I had made a few small projects to help cement new ideas and concepts I was learning, this was the largest endeavor I had undertaken with my self-taught knowledge. I enjoy finding inspiration for projects from my personal interests, and building an interactive starship console was very gratifying.</p>

        <p><strong>Initial Calibration</strong></p><br>
      </div>
      <p>This was my first real attempt at creating a class populated with methods in Ruby. I started by organizing all of my variables within the initialize method, followed by a stylish boot-up screen.</p><br>
      <p>This project really helped solidify my love of creating an immersive experience for the user. The elipses and <code>sleep</code> pauses give the sense that there's a lot happening behind the scenes as ship's systems come online.</p><br>

<!-- Section: Main Menu -->
<div class="section system_manager">
  <div class="main_container">
    <div class="img_container">
      <%= image_tag("starship_setstatus.png", :class => "starship setstatus code") %>
      <%= image_tag("starship_mainmenu.png", :class => "starship mainmenu code") %>

    <div class="text bridge_description">
      <div class="subject">
        <p><strong>Main Menu</strong></p><br>
      </div>
      <p>After the calibration the user sets up the name of the ship and the captain. The program calls the <code>status</code> method and feeds it the name variables to display at the top of the menu.</p><br>
      <p>Similarly as above, the screen is written line at a time with intricately spaced text. However, unlike the later programs, this one checks the status of the variables set in the <code>initialize</code> method and displays the corresponding message according to a conditional statement.</p><br>
      <p>At the end it calls the <code>select</code> method which asks for the user input. The user simply types in the name of the system they want to interact with.</p><br>
      <p><code>@phasers, @photons, </code>and <code>@shields</code> are simple boolean statements which the user can set to true or false.</p>
    </div>

<!-- Section: Alerts -->
<div class="section system_manager">
  <div class="main_container">
    <div class="text bridge_description">
      <div class="subject">
        <p><strong>Alerts</strong></p><br>
      </div>
      <p>The first bit of tricky code is the alert system. Instead of immediately changing the menu like with the booleans, this opens a second prompt asking the user what alert status they wish to set.</p><br>

      <p>The user has to type in the full alert status. Nearly all of the user input is put through the <code>.downcase</code> method in order to deal with any capitalization discrepancies. The <code>alerts</code> array is therefore all lowercase, while the prompt is capitalized. In this way I could not simply call the <code>alerts</code> array and display it as a string with a <code>.join</code> method.</p><br>
      <p>When the user picks an alert status the program calls the main menu again and replaces the top text with the new alert status</p><br>
      <p>The <code>@alert</code> variable is updated from a blank array to its new value and displayed accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img_container">
      <%= image_tag("starship_alerts.png", :class => "starship alerts code") %>
    </div>
  </div>

<!-- Section: Engines - Impulse -->
<div class="section system_manager">
  <div class="main_container">
    <div class="img_container">
      <%= image_tag("starship_impulse.png", :class => "starship impulse code") %>
    </div>
    <div class="text bridge_description">
      <div class="subject">
        <p><strong>Impulse Engines</strong></p><br>
      </div>
      <p>Like the alerts, when the user selects engines it prompts them to specify between Impulse and Warp Engines.</p><br>
      <p>The Impulse Engines work just like the alerts, calling the main menu, changing the top text, and updating the @ variable.

<!-- Section: Engines - Warp -->

  <div class="main_container">
    <div class="text bridge_description">
      <div class="subject">
        <p><strong>Warp Engines</strong></p><br>
      </div>
      <p>For the Warp engines I set a variable <code>warp</code> as a range between 1 and 9. The program asks the user for a specific warp speed and checks their response against that range.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img_container">
      <%= image_tag("starship_warp.png", :class => "starship warp code") %>
    </div>

<!-- Section: Sensors -->
<div class="section system_manager">
  <div class="main_container">
    <div class="img_container">
      <%= image_tag("starship_sensors.png", :class => "starship sensors code") %>
    </div>
    <div class="text bridge_description">
      <div class="subject">
        <p><strong>Sensors</strong></p><br>
      </div>
      <p>At the time the sensors were the trickiest bit of code I had ever made on my own.</p><br>
      <p>Using the <code>.each</code> method I list each of the possible ship sensors for the user.</p><br>
      <p>In order to check the user response against the <code>sensorlist</code> I split the response string, mapped it to a new array, capitalized the array, then joined it all back together with spaces. In this way I can take whatever capitalization the user typed and let it match the <code>sensorlist</code> without having to resort to having an all lowercase array and typing it out a second time capitalized for the user prompt (like with the alerts).</p><br>
      <p>While I don't have the exact source, this was an answer I found online and fit to work on my project.</p><br>
      <p>One neat thing is that, unlike the other ship's systems, the user can set more than one sensor to be active at a time. The selected sensor is pushed to the <code>@sensors</code> array in the main menu, or deleted from the array when deactivated.</p>

<!-- Final Thoughts -->

        <p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p><br>
      </div>
      <p>I like that I created a loop over the whole program without using a <code>while</code> statement, instead calling new methods which in turn called the main menu when they completed. It's not how I would go on to learn loops, but at the time, for something as sophisticated as this program was, it felt like a real achievement.</p><br>
      <p>I'm also proud of  promping the user on which systems they may interact with, and then allowing them to type in full sentences if they wish. Using the <code>.include?</code> method lets the program scan the user response for the prompted keywords like phasers or engines and react appropriately. It's just another way of creating immersion for the user.</p><br>
      <p>Inside every user input is the possibility that they will pick an option that is unavailable. I enjoyed creating while loops in every user response that checked the user response against all valid responses and would return a Command Not Recognized error to the user before allowing them to choose again. The loop would only break once they selected something the program could proceed with.</p><br>
      <p>The thorough use of documentation was immensely helpful while developing this project. While at the time I only knew to use comments as section headings, I know enjoy using them as notes, placeholders, and instructions.</p>
